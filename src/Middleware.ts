/** @returns redux middleware to support undo/redo actions.
 *
 * The middleware does two things:
 *
 * 1) for undo/redo actions, the middlware attaches some information to the action.
 * It attaches the 'raw' state object. easy peasy normally sends only an immer
 * proxy of the raw state, and the proxy obscures the difference between computed
 * and regular properties.
 * For undo/redo actions the middleware also attaches the user provided noSaveKeys
 * filter function. (Note that passing the filter function with every undo/redo action
 * is a bit inefficient. The thought is to be cleaner for the undo-peasy user
 * with the config in one place, rather than some config on the middleware and
 * some config in undoable())
 *
 * 2) for normal actions, the middeware dispatches an additional undoSave action to
 * follow the original action. The reducer for the undoSave action will save the state
 * in undo history.
